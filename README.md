# a5_Reversi

A very rudimentary human vs computer Reversi game that was done for a first year school assignment. \
The computer player is extremely rudimentary.

The game operates inside the terminal. \
The player inputs their move and the computer excecutes their move. \
All moves are displayed within the terminal.

LEGEND:
1) "." - Empty Space
2) "0" - Computer's Piece (white piece)
3) "X" - Player's Piece (black piece)
4) "#" - Valid Space Location

Code was originally written to compile and run in Linux. Output to terminal was coloured for easier interpretation.

A) The "reversi_a5" file (non .cpp) is an executable for Linux
 - in console navigated to the directory in which the file is in, enter: `./reversi_a5`

B) The "reversi_a5_win.exe" is an executable for Windows
- in console navigated to the directory in which the file is in, enter: `reversi_a5_win.exe`
 - ~~The coloured display to console of the original code does not work so it currently operates without colour~~
 - ~~Game otherwise works but is harder to see compared to its Linux counterpart~~
 - ~~May look on how to implement the colour functionality for windows in the future~~
