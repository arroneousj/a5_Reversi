# a5_Reversi

A human vs computer Reversi game that was done for a first year school assignment.

Code runs in Linux as the formatting used to write to terminal appears to work only for the Linux terminal.

1) The "reversi_a5" file (non .cpp file) is an executable for Linux
 - in console navigated to the directory in which the file is in, enter: *./reversi_a5*

It "runs" in Windows as the logic and everything works.
But the display is unintuative and makes it extremely difficult to understand what is happening and to make the corresponding moves.
